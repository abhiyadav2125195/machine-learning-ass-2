    "Reducing overfitting in machine learning involves strategies to prevent the model from learning noise and irrelevant patterns from the training data, thus improving its ability to generalize to new, unseen data. Here are some key techniques to reduce overfitting:\n",
    "\n",
    "More Data: Increasing the size of the training dataset provides the model with a broader range of examples, making it harder for the model to memorize noise and increasing its chances of capturing true patterns.\n",
    "\n",
    "Simpler Models: Choosing simpler models with fewer parameters reduces their capacity to fit noise and complex interactions. This can include using linear models or shallower neural networks.\n",
    "\n",
    "Regularization: Regularization techniques add penalty terms to the loss function, discouraging the model from assigning excessive weights to certain features. Common regularization methods include L1 (Lasso) and L2 (Ridge) regularization.\n",
    "\n",
    "Cross-Validation: Employ techniques like k-fold cross-validation to assess the model's performance on multiple splits of the data. This helps identify whether the model's performance holds consistently across different subsets of the data.\n",

    "Bias:\n",
    "\n",
    "Definition: Bias refers to the error introduced by approximating a real-world problem, which may be complex, by a simplified model. High bias implies the model makes strong assumptions about the data, leading to systematic errors.\n",
    "Effect: Models with high bias tend to oversimplify the problem, ignoring important relationships and patterns. They are likely to underfit the training data, performing poorly both on training and new data.\n",

    "Variance:\n",
    "\n",
    "Definition: Variance refers to the model's sensitivity to small fluctuations or variations in the training data. High variance implies the model captures noise and random fluctuations.\n",
    "Effect: Models with high variance fit the training data very closely but may fail to generalize to new data. They are sensitive to noise and small changes in the training data, leading to overfitting.\n",

    "Relationship between Bias and Variance:\n",
    "\n",
    "As you reduce bias (make the model more complex), variance tends to increase. A more complex model can fit the training data better but might capture noise, leading to overfitting and high variance.\n",

    "Bias-Dominant Scenario: In cases where the model is too simplistic (high bias), it may consistently miss important patterns in the data. The model's predictions will be systematically off from the actual values.\n",
